This repository aims to gather my most valuable and useful configuration files in one
place so that I can (relatively) easily transfer them between machines, and save my
productivity from suffering too much from the discomfort of default configs.

The config files are currently just somewhat haphazardly tossed together in here. In
the future, I'd like to have a section here for each one, and I'd like to comment
them thoroughly.

### Plugins

Here is a list of plugins that I deem to be very useful when using Vim as your main
editor in everyday work.

-   **Essential**
    -   [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) – allows plugins to be
        placed in separate directories
    -   [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) – tree explorer sidebar
    -   [YouCompleteMe](https://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/) – code completion
    -   [vim-repeat](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) – allows dot-repeating of
        plugin commands
    -   [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) – easy manipulation of
        surrounding characters

-   **Nice to have**
    -   [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) – integration with ack
    -   [Align](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Align) – align multiple lines
        according to a regex (see also: [Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular))

        file/buffer/project search
